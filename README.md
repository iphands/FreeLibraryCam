# Free Library Cam

## About
This project is for our [Little Free Library](https://littlefreelibrary.org/).
It adds a small camera to the library so that library patrons can snap a photo of themselves
and see it on the net.

## Note
This is still very much still a work in progress.

I'm working on the solar setup still (I lose power at around 1am :D),
and working on optimizing the power draw of the ESP32 still. 

## It uses:
- An [ESP32-CAM module](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07S5PVZKV/)
- An [over sized push button](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071FSKY6Q/)
- Some spare solar parts I had laying around
- An old 12v to USB car adapter
- And a Python container server side

At the moment the setup uploads to [this Imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/nwV1Ow9).
