# Free Library Cam

This project is for our [Little Free Library](https://littlefreelibrary.org/).
It adds a small camera to the library so that library patrons can snap a photo of themselves
and see it on the net.

It uses:
- An [ESP32-CAM module](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07S5PVZKV/)
- An [over sized push button](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071FSKY6Q/)
- Some spare solar parts I had laying around
- An old 12v to USB car adapter
- And a Python container server side

At the moment the setup uploads to [this Imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/nwV1Ow9).
